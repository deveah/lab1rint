lab1rint
========
A mobile-friendly HTML5 maze game.

### About
_lab1rint_ is a game in which the player must traverse a maze, whose layout
is shown for a brief period of time at the beginning of the level, thus making
the player use his/her memory in order to successfully move back and forth the
levels.

The scope each level is traversing the maze from one end to the other.
To move, just swipe the screen in the direction that you want to move.

Successfully clearing a level awards you one score point, while losing resets
your score.

*The game is meant to be difficult.* If you don't find it difficult, please
send me an email, so I can be able to fix the issue.

*The game is meant to be short.* It's meant to be played while waiting for
the bus, or other short periods of boredom which you'd prefer not to exist.
There's no difficulty increase between levels (at least for now), and the
only maze you'll see is four by four.

### Bugs
So far, the only bug I've noticed is that, on a device which hasn't previously
accessed the game, the screen may be zoomed in in the upper left corner of
the screen. Refreshing takes care of this issue, until I can pin down the exact
cause.

Please report any bugs you may encounter, so I can address the issues.

### Licensing
_lab1rint_ is licensed under the terms and conditions of the _MIT license_.
